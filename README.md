# Type Conversions

1. `DoubleOps.java`

Create a program that takes two numerical command line arguments, and, in a pretty user-friendly way, demonstrates use of each of the methods in the `Math Class` section of the Java Quick Reference, using the number(s) passed in.

2. `TrigIdentity.java`

Create a program that takes one double, `theta` (which represents an angle) as a command line argument. The program should print the value of sin^2(`theta`) + cos^2(`theta`) which, according to trigonometry, should always have a value of 1. Note: `sin` and `cos` are methods available in the Java `Math` library.

3. `Quadratic.java`

Create a program that takes three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the coefficients of a quadratic equation. Print the two solutions to the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. It's OK if your program crashes given coefficients that correspond to a quadratic equation that has no solution.
